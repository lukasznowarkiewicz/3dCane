# 3dCane


## Introduction
In 2017, we, Jacek Martyniak and ≈Åukasz Nowarkiewicz from the Electrical and Electronic School in Szczecin, under the guidance of our mentor with a PhD, Dariusz Mostowski, took on a project for the XVII Innovation and Invention Olympics. Our goal was simple: to design an intelligent electronic cane for the visually impaired and blind. This cane was intended to make navigating both outdoor city environments and indoor spaces easier for them. We focused on ensuring the cane was easy and intuitive to use, with a modular design that could be produced and maintained at a reasonable cost.
